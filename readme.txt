All characters go in this folder.

All the necessary images of a character must be inside a folder with the name
of the character (in lower case, and the same name as the 4 files in the data
folder), and the images must be named "character_01","character_06", etc.

Files that must appear:
-character_01: the cover page of the character's book
-character_06 to character_37: the pages of the character, from 01-02 to
  63-64
-character_02: the 2p color for the character, if available (if not
  available, it's better if a "character_02" file isn't present, or 
  that file would be shown as 2p)

The other images aren't used and may appear in whatever order
